# ChangQing — Simple Portfolio

This is a minimal static site to showcase paintings. It includes three sections: Biography, Paintings, and Artistic Practice, with a Chinese/English language switcher.

How to view locally:

```sh
# from project directory
open index.html    # macOS
# or run a simple server
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Edit `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `scripts.js` to add content or more images (place images in the `images/` folder).
